# Musical Breakout
## JavaScript - HTML - CSS - Canvas - Logic Pro X

Welcome to the `Musical Breakout` repo! This is my sonically pleasing version of the classic arcade game Breakout.

This game was made with the pure simplicity of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

---------------------

I used an HTML Canvas to animate the game. I designed and recorded custom music and audio samples that are integrated into gameplay, making every round a unique experience.

---------------------

I designed my own load-balancer using several <audio> tags. 

Experimenting with `event listeners` and `keyframes`, I was able to match up audio samples with their textual representations and have them fly across the screen responsively.

Includes mute button for when you need a break from the lovely soundtrack.

Players can use their mouse to point-and-shoot:

Continuous playback when you win or lose means the music never has to end!

I hope you have as much fun playing Musical Breakout as I did making it!
